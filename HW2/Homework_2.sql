1. CARBO: Using the dh carbo data, compute dollar sales per store for pasta
sauce and separately the dollar sales for pasta.
a) Present the SQL query you used for this calculation.
b) Using JMPâ€™s Graph Builder, create side-by-side box plots of these totals per
store, separated by geography. (You will have 4 box plots.) Copy the graph
and comment on what insights this graph provides.
